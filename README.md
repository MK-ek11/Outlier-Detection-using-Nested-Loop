## Description
Course: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (Fall 2021) <br />
Task: Write own code


> A distance-based outlier detection method consults the neighborhood of an object, which is defined by a given radius. An object is then considered an outlier if its neighborhood does not have enough other points.
